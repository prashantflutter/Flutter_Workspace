    21. What is inheritance?
    Ans :-  one class all functionality pass other class is called inheritance

    22. Which inheritance is not supported by Dart? Why? B3. What is
        advantage of inheritance?
    Ans :- In Dart multiple inheritance is not supported.
          dart is dynamic language that why not supported.
          Many time developer use other class method or variable eny thing code then
          using
          inheritance is easy to implement and use.


    23. Difference between inheritance and encapsulation.
    B5. Difference between inheritance and abstraction.
    Ans :- inheritance use for all functionality of one class to any other class.
           encapsulation use for wrap data and binding data.
          abstraction use for the hide method and show functionality which we want.

   24. Difference between inheritance and polymorphism
   Ans :- inheritance use for all functionality of one class to any other class.
          polymorphism have two method 1) overloading 2)overriding but dart
         is supported dynamic language that why overloading method not work


    25. Can we override static method in Dart?
    Ans :- NO, we can't override static methods

    26. Can we overload static method in Dart?
    Ans :- overload method not support dart and also static method not overload.


    27. Can a class implement more than one interface?
    B10. Can a class extend more than one class in Dart?
    Ans :- yes we are implement more then interface in class.
          no we can not extend more then one class.


    28. Can an interface extend more than one interface in Dart?
    Ans :- Yes we interface extend more than one interface in Dart

    29. What will happen if a class implements two interfaces and they both
     have a method with same name and signature?
    Ans :- if class implement two interfaces and both have a same then only one
          method show because of dart.dart have supported dynamic language that why.

    30. Can we pass an object of a subclass to a method expecting an object of
       the super class? B14. Are static members inherited to sub classes?
    Ans :- yes we pass an object of a subclass.
          yes we can use static members inherited to sub classes

    31. What happens if the parent and the child class have a field with
       same identifier? B16. Are constructors and initializers also inherited to
       sub classes?
   Ans :- if the parent and child class have a same field then child identifier use                 first.
          yes constructors and initializers also inherited to sub class.

   32. How do you restrict a member of a class from inheriting by its sub classes?
   Ans :- No we can don't restrict a member of a class using inheriting by its sub          classes

   33. How do you implement multiple inheritance in Dart?
   Ans :- we can not implement multiple inheritance in dart

   34. Can a class extend by itself in Dart?
   Ans :- class not extend by itself in dart.

  35. How do you override a private method in Dart?
  Ans :-

  36. When to overload a method in Dart and when to override it?
  Ans :- when override a method then we use abstract and implement as interface
        and overloading then we use optional parameter

   38. How do you prevent overriding a Dart method without using the final modifier?
   Ans :-

   39. What are the rules of method overriding in Dart?
   Ans :- The return type should be the same as in the method present in the superclass.

 40. Difference between method overriding and overloading in Dart
 Ans :-      overriding                       |               overloading
           -------------------------------------------------------------------------
            overriding method support in Dart | overloading is not supported in Dart



 41. What happens when a class implements two interfaces and both declare field (variable) with same name?
   Ans :- if the class implement two interfaces and declare field same then one method show in class because
    dart is dynamic language supported
